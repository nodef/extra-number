A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. [Number]
type is double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. This package
includes common number functions related to querying *about* numbers,
*comparing* numbers, *rounding* numbers, performing *rounded division*,
performing *modulo* operations, *controlling range* of numbers, performing
*arithmetic* operations, obtaining *divisors* of a number (and related
operations), getting the number of possible *arrangements* of a set of objects,
performing *geometry*-related calculations, performing basic *statistical*
analysis, and finding various *statistical means*.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. The web format
is exposed as `extra_number` standalone variable and can be loaded from
[jsDelivr CDN].
